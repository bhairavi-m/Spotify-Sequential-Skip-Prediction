# Session-based Sequential Skip Prediction: Spotify 

### Abstract
Spotify is a leading music streaming service with over
365 million monthly active users with around 70 million tracks that the users are engaging with, valued
at $ 41.06 billion. This service is fuelled by its customisation and music knowledge driven by algorithms
and not community-created playlists. Our motive
is to understand the way users sequentially interact
with music. This project will focus on the task of
session-based sequential skip prediction, i.e. predicting whether users will skip tracks, given their immediately preceding interactions in their listening session.
We describe two types of solution approaches in this
paper and analyse them in detail.

### Motivation
The main challenge for Spotify is to recommend the
right music to each user and hence most of the work
focuses on Recommender Systems and a little on
describing how users sequentially interact with the
streamed content they are presented with. In particular within music, the question of if, and when,
a user skips a track is an important implicit feedback signal. This is an exciting Supervised Machine
Learning problem as it helps us understand intricate
behavioural patterns of how users engage with tracks
and which of the track features play an important
role in this prediction.
